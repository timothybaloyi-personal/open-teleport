# Open-Teleport

A Chrome extension designed for power users and developers to optimize their AI workflow with prompt standardization, token management, and persistent memory storage.

## Features

### 1. Prompt Repository & Templates
- Store and manage a library of reusable prompt instructions within the extension
- Standardize workflows across different AI models and use cases
- Ensure consistency in AI-generated outputs through template-based prompting
- Quick access to frequently used prompt configurations

### 2. Smart Prompt Injection & Wrapping
- Enter your base prompt and let the extension automatically enhance it
- Apply selected prompt templates/configurations to wrap or inject standardized instructions
- Seamlessly integrate system prompts, context, and formatting rules
- Switch between different prompt strategies without manual rewriting

### 3. Token Estimation & Optimization
- Real-time token count calculation for your prompts
- Rough estimation display before sending to AI models
- Helps optimize prompt length for API cost management
- Supports multiple tokenization methods (GPT, Claude, etc.)

### 4. Memory Integration & Webhooks
- Connect to personal knowledge bases (NotebookLM, Git repositories, etc.)
- Read from and write to external memory storage via webhooks
- Persistent context across sessions for enhanced AI interactions
- Sync important outputs to your personal documentation system
- Bidirectional memory flow: fetch context for prompts, save responses for future reference

## Use Cases

- **Developers**: Standardize code review prompts, documentation generation, and debugging workflows
- **Content Creators**: Maintain consistent tone and style across AI-assisted writing
- **Researchers**: Build reusable prompt libraries for data analysis and literature reviews
- **Teams**: Share prompt templates and maintain organizational knowledge bases
